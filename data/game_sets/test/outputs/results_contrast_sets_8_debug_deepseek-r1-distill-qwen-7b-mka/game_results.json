For example, chickens, robins, starlings, foxes, partridges, buffaloes are all animals, while elk and hamsters are mammals. Wait, no, wait: hamsters are mammals, but elk is an animal too, right? Or is it a mammal? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. But maybe a better starting point is whether the animal can fly or not, since two of them, robins and starlings, can fly, while others might not. Let me think.\n\nIf I ask, \"Does it fly?\" and consider the answers:\n\n- Elk: Can it fly? No.\n- Chicken: Yes, chickens can fly.\n- Robin: Yes, can fly.\n- Starling: Yes, can fly.\n- Fox: No, can't fly.\n- Partridge: Yes, can fly.\n- Hamster: No, can't fly.\n- buffalo: No, can't fly.\n</think>\n\nMy question for this turn: \\boxed{Does it fly?}",

One good way is to ask about whether they have fur or not because sheep, fawn, and ostriches are mammals and have fur, while zebras and deer are also mammals but have different features.\n\nSo, asking, \"Does it have fur?\" should work well.
