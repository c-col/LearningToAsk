My goal is to split the list into two as equally as possible with a yes/no question. Let me think about categories that can divide them effectively.\n\nOne approach is to separate living things from non-living things. Looking at the list, the living things are dinosaur, cow, giganotosaurus, siberian husky, tree. The rest are either objects, emotions, concepts, etc. That's 5 living items and 20 non-living. If I ask \"Is it a living thing?\", that might not split them evenly, but it's a start.
